## Problem B: Customizing the Track (Solved in Contest)
https://codeforces.com/contest/1543/problem/B

<ins>Strategy</ins>: Making Everything as close to the same number as possible. x * (n-x) where x is abs of floor of average of nums - sum of nums.
<br>
<i>Time Complexity</i>: O(n)
<br>
<i>Space Complexity</i>:O(1)

<br>
## Problem C: Need for Pink Slips (Solved after Contest)
https://codeforces.com/contest/1543/problem/B

<ins>Strategy</ins>: DFS all combinations while c and m are > 0. Turn floating point numbers into integer with a scale factor to get acceptable relative error.
